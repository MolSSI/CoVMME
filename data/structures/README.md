  - NSP5
  - NSP6
  - NSP7
  - NSP8
  - NSP9

  - viral fusion
  - host immune response
  - cell cycle inhibitors
annotation: (optional) Otherwise will be set to RCSB PDB Title
rating: (optinal) (1= poor quality to 5=best quality)
organisms: (required) (one or more fo the following options as a list)
  - SARS-CoV-2
  - SARS-CoV
  - human
ligands: (optional)
publication: (optional) URL of the publication if not fetchable from RCSB (RCSB prioritized)
preprint: (optional) URL of the preprint for the publication. Can also be used to note if submitted by the exact word "Submitted"
```

## Notes
* The fields provided here are necessary to cross-link data among categories.
* Information that can be fetched directly from the PDB via the `pdbid` does not need to be populated.
  Only annotation information is needed. The rest can be scraped from the PDB via the API or by retrieving the PDB file.
  This includes resolution, method, name, publication DOI.
* `data_type` is not needed because the directory organization will identify that this is a structure.
