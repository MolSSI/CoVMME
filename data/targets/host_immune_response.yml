target: host immune response
name: Managing the host immune response
description: >
  Certain mechanisms allow viruses to avoid host immune response, such as removal of ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein conjugated to intracellular proteins post interferon activation and involved in cell-to-cell signaling and heightened immune response. Removal of such tags and disruption of signal cascades allow infected cells to avoid apoptotic signals.
