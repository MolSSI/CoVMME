target: "nsp10-nsp16 complexing for viral translation efficiency" 
description: >
  nsp10, nonstructural protein 10, is an nsp activator required to initiate nsp14's
  proofreading exoribonuclease with (guanine-N7) methyl transferase activity for viral 
  mRNA capping and nsp16's 2'-O-mehtyltransferase activity. Both nsp14/16 interact at 
  the same nsp10 surface and disrupting this complex formation can decrease translational 
  efficiency of viral mRNAs and promote recognition of foreign RNA to enhance innate immune
  reponses.
