target: "3CLpro protease activity"
name: 3CLpro / Mpro activity
description: >
  3CLpro (main protease, M-PRO, etc) is a viral cysteine protease
  responsible for maturation of the viral polyprotein, necessary for
  infection. It is the target of many drug discovery campaigns. 3CLpro is
  an obligate dimer, although many drug design efforts just use a monomer
  structure. Two potential therapeutic modalities exist, the first being
  active site inhibition, and the second being dimerization inhibition.

  - 3CLpro
