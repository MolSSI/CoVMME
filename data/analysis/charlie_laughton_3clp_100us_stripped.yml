title: Analysis of DESRES 100 µs MD of 3CLpro, no water or ions
description:
    This notebook analyses the DE Shaw dataset 'DESRES 100 µs MD of 3CLpro, no water or ions (100 µs )'  
    (see https://covid.molssi.org/simulations/#sars-cov-2-main-protease-3clpro-or-nsp5) and extracts a 
    reasonably-sized but diverse subset of structures of the catalytic domain that may be useful for, 
    e.g., docking studies. Structures ('waymarks') are picked sequentially from both A chain and B 
    chain copies of the catalytic domain in each snapshot, if their minimum rmsd from any previously 
    selected structure exceeds a user-defined threshold. These waymarks are then used to produce a Voronoi 
    partitioning of the trajectory. Waymarks defining domains that include more than a set minimum fraction 
    of the trajectory snapshots are then output in PDB format.
