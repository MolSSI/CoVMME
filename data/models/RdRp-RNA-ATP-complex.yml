name: "SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex (nsp12+2*nsp8+nsp7) + RNA template-primer + ATP  model for MD simulations"
description: Model of the RdRp + RNA + ATP complex of the SARS-CoV-2 with non-covalently bound ATP molecule is built using homology
  modelling with the SARS-CoV-1 RdRp complex (PDB:6NUR) as template structure (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10280-3). The 
  modelled structure shows excellent fit (< 0.6 Å) to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex (PDB:6M71) kindly shared with us by Gao et.al.
  Further, the model of RdRp complex with RNA and ATP molecule in Tri-phosphate form is modelled based on comparative
  fitting with previously known poliovirus and norovirus structres (with NTP molecule in hydrophobic cleft). The protein-RNA
  complex with Remdesivir shows excellent fit (< 0.7 Å) with the recently published RdRp complex with RNA template-primer 
  (PDB:7BV2, 6YYT). The fitted models have been equilibriated to perform long MD simulations.
