name: "SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein binding to FDA approved or investigational drug molecules"
pdbids:
  - 6vxx
  - 6vw1
proteins:
  - spike
  - RBD
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2  
description: >
  Spike trimer constructed from PDB entries 6VXX and 6VW1, only retaining the RBD and a short region from S1 fusion protein as a 
  minimal system for maintaining a trimer assembly. The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration 
  of 0.15 M. The interval between frames is 1.2 ns. The simulations were conducted at 310 K in the NPT ensemble.
