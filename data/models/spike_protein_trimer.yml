name: "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer (closed state) model for MD simulations"
description: >
  Model of the spike protein trimer of SARS-CoV-2 virus in closed conformation. 
  That trimer is built from the homology model of monomer made by Thomas Desautels et.al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885)
  It has been replicated and fitted to the known structure of SARS-CoV-1 by Wenfei Song et.al. PDBID: 6ACK (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007236). 
  That model has been made to perform MD simulations.
