  Original model has numerous quite severe (albeit local) problems:
    * spurious non-proline cis/twisted peptide bonds at A281-282, A285-286, A350-351, A353-354, A439-440, A551-552, B-1-0, B189-190, B206-207, B467-468
    * high clashscore of 28.7
    * only 79.6% of residues in favoured portion of Ramachandran plot (should be near 98%)
    * C-terminal domains (~439 to end) nearly unresolved and severely distorted
    * Some long loops were modelled despite having no discernable density.
  Rebuilt well-resolved regions directly into density. Trimmed off unresolved loops. 
  In the MERS equivalent of this complex (5wwp) the C-terminal domain is well-resolved (but needed 
  substantial rebuilding in its own right). After rebuilding, I used this (chain A, residues 439 to end)
  as a reference model (distance and torsion-based) to improve the poorly-resolved C-terminal domains
  in 6jyt. Given the poor density it cannot be said that these domains are perfect, but application of 
  the restraints substantially improved both R-factors and geometry.
