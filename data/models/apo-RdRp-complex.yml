name: "SARS-CoV-2 apo-RdRp complex (nsp12+2*nsp8+nsp7) model for MD simulations"
description: Model of the apo-protein form of RdRp complex of the SARS-CoV-2 is built using homology modelling with the 
  SARS-CoV-1 RdRp complex (PDB:6NUR) as template structure (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10280-3). The modelled structure
  shows excellent fit (< 0.6 Å) to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex (PDB:6M71,7BV1) kindly shared with us by Gao et.al.
  The fitted models have been equilibriated to perform long MD simulations.
