name: GitHub Repo for building an nsp13 / helicase homology model
description: > 
  Current structures of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase are limited, and
  the only structures from other coronaviruses are not ligand bound. To
  facilitate drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 helicase, we need to determine a
  model of the helicase bound to ATP and / or RNA.
