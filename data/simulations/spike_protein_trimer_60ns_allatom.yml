title: Gromacs 60 ns MD of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, All Atom model
description: >
  This trajectory is from a 60 ns MD simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The protein was solvated in a 20 x 20 x 20 nm  water
  box containing 0.1 M NaCl. The simulation was performed with Gromacs 2018.8 on the Puhti cluster located at the CSC-IT using the Charmm27 force field. The interval
  between frames is 80 ps. The simulation was conducted in the NPT ensemble (1 bar). This trajectory is all atom.
