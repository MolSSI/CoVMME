title: Gromacs 100 ns MD of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp + RNA template-primer + ATP model, All Atom model
description: >
  This trajectory is from a 100 ns atomic MD simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-RNA-ATP-complex protein. The protein was solvated in a 
  16 x 16 x 16 nm box of solvent containing water and 0.15 M NaCl. The simulation was performed with Gromacs 2018.8 
  on the Puhti cluster located at the CSC-IT using the Amber14sb-OL15 force field. The interval
  between frames is 100 ps. The simulation was conducted in the NPT ensemble (1 bar and 300K).
