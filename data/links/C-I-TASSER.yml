description: >
  This page contains 3D structural models and function annotation for all proteins encoded by the genome of 2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2, which is the novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pneumonia. The structure models are generated by the C-I-TASSER pipeline, which utilizes deep convolutional neural-network based contact-map predictions to guide the I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Benchmark and blind CASP tests showed that C-I-TASSER generates models with a higher accuracy than I-TASSER does, especially for the protein targets lack of homologous templates. For multi-domain targets, the C-I-TASSER structure of individual domains are assembled by DEMO into full length structure.
