description: >
  The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries and APIs gives you the ability to execute end-to-end data science
  and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. RAPIDS is meant to help make data science easier to program and execute
  on CUDA-capable GPUs by allowing developers to interface through through user-friendly Python interfaces.


  RAPIDS also focuses on common data preparation tasks for analytics and data science. This includes a familiar
  dataframe API that integrates with a variety of machine learning algorithms for end-to-end pipeline accelerations
  without paying typical serialization costs. RAPIDS also includes support for multi-node, multi-GPU deployments,
  enabling vastly accelerated processing and training on much larger dataset sizes.
