# Organizations for common reference

## To add new resources

Contribute a separate [YAML file](https://yaml.org/) for each entry.

### YAML schema

Each entry has the following required and optional keys:
```
name: (required) Organization Name
short: (optional) Short name or acronym if people want it
logo: (optional) name of the logo file in the /static/images/org-logos directory
url: (optional) Link to the organization
```

### Visual Display Caveat

The logo for the organization, when referenced on the Collaborators page will be scaled to 44x33.
Please make sure your logo is appropriate at that scale (you can use the site preview when you make a
PR to check this).

If your logo cannot be rendered at that size or makes the quality unacceptable, please not that in an 
issue and we can work to resolve it together.
