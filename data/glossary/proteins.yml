term: Proteins
short: The biological proteins associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and host.
long: >
  The biological proteins associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and host that impact the viral infection cycle.


  Due to the significant overlap between SARS-CoV-2 (Common Name: COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (Common Name: SARS), many of the
  proteins applicable to both, but defer to SARS-CoV-2. When a structure, model, or simulation is of a SARS-CoV based
  nature, it will be explicitly denoted. If no notation appears, it is applicable to SARS-CoV-2.
