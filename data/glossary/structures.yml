term: Structures
short: Data defining structures determined by experimental methods and referenced via a unique identifier such as a PDB ID.
long: >
  Experimentally and calculated molecular structures of the proteins.


  Sub-structures for each protein should be grouped under the primary structure.


  Groupings of multiple protein structures are listed here if they were derived from experimental methods,
  however, for any sort of post-measurement modeling, they are in "Models." For example, The Viral Spike S1 might be
  interacting with the Host ACE2 (for interfering with binding); this would be considered a "model."


  Due to the significant overlap between SARS-CoV-2 (Common Name: COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (Common Name: SARS), many of the
  structures could be applied for homology research. When a structure, is of a SARS-CoV based nature, it will be explicitly
  denoted. If no notation appears, it is applicable to SARS-CoV-2.
