term: Models
short: Derived, integrated, or refined structures from multiple data sources prepared for different computational tasks.
long: >
  Derived and/or integrated structures from multiple data sources prepared for different tasks such as docking, FEP,
  virtual screening, etc. Effectively ready to go constructed molecular systems which can be used as inputs for myriad
  scientific research techniques.


  Due to the significant overlap between SARS-CoV-2 (Common Name: COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (Common Name: SARS), many of the
  models could be applied for homology research. When a model, is of a SARS-CoV based nature, it will be explicitly
  denoted. If no notation appears, it is applicable to SARS-CoV-2.
