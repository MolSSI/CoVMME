short: The datasets produced as a result of applying the models to different scientific techniques.

  The datasets produced as a result of applying the models to different techniques.
  This would also include all the possible input files, scripts, etc. necessary to run the technique. For Molecular
  Dynamics, this would be things like the trajectory; for docking, this would be things like the poses and scores.


  Due to the significant overlap between SARS-CoV-2 (Common Name: COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (Common Name: SARS), many of the
  simulations could be applied for homology research. When a simulation  is of a SARS-CoV based
  nature, it will be explicitly denoted. If no notation appears, it is applicable to SARS-CoV-2.
