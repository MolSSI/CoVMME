## Abstract 

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical enzyme for the maturation of viral particles and a potential 
target for antiviral drugs. 
There are three trajectories here: A 100-microsecond MD simulation of the apo enzyme started from the apo 
enzyme structure determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB entry 6Y84) (All atom, no water/ions, and structure), 
and two 10-microsecond simulation trajectories of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

## Full Description

### 100 Microsecond Trajectory, ID: DESRES-ANTON-10880334
  
The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical enzyme for the maturation of viral particles and a potential target for 
antiviral drugs. This trajectory is from a 100-microsecond MD simulation of the apo enzyme started from the apo enzyme 
structure determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB entry 6Y84)2. The protein was solvated in a 120 x 120 x 120 
Angstrom water box containing 0.15 M NaCl. The simulation was performed on Anton 2 using the DES-Amber force field3. 
The interval between frames is 1 nanosecond. The simulation was conducted in the NPT ensemble.

### 10 Microsecond Simulations, ID: DESRES-ANTON-10897136 and DESRES-ANTON-10897850 

Two 10-microsecond simulation trajectories of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. 
Trajectory 1 was initiated in the closed state (PDB entry 6VXX)4, and trajectory 2 in a partially opened state 
(PDB entry 6VYB). In the simulations, the closed state remained stable whereas the partially opened state exhibited a 
high degree of conformational heterogeneity. In particular, the partially detached receptor binding domain sampled a 
variety of orientations, and further detached from the S2 fusion machinery. The simulations used the Amber ff99SB-ILDN f
orce field5 for proteins, the CHARMM TIP3P model6 for water, and the generalized Amber force field7 for glycosylated 
asparagine. The C- and N-peptide termini, including those exposed due to missing loops in the published structural 
models, are capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a 
final concentration of 0.15 M. The total number of atoms in the system was 715439 for the open state and 566502 for the 
closed state. The interval between frames is 1.2 nanoseconds. The simulations were conducted in the NPT ensemble.
