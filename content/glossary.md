## Glossary

The Hub employs terminology self-consistently throughout the site. However, some of these terms may be 
ambiguous or appear to overlap due to the common appears of these terms in the broader scientific community.

We define each term here, and how they relate to each other to reduce collisions of the terms as they apply elsewhere.

The terms here appear alphabetically and link to the primary page where the term applies (if applicable)
