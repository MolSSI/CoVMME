Structures on this page are grouped in tiers:

1. Viral VS Host
2. Active interest VS low interest in drug discovery
3. Therapeutic Modality (Target)
4. Structure Star Rating
5. Model Star Ratings

Because of the sorting, structures may appear in multiple groups under the first three categories,
but they will all link out to the same locations.

Many structural annotations and reviews come from the [Coronavirus Structural Task Force](https://insidecorona.net/).

More ★ = higher rated structures. 

Zero ★ indicate no rating is done yet.
